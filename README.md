================
Basic Minesweeper operation code! We've got a fair bit of work to do. 
What needs to happen: 

Finalise Sensor code
&#10003;

<strike>Setup system to monitor turning degrees</strike>
Didn't get gyro/compass in time, resorting to using timing to turn 90&deg;
I know this is bad and will change under load, but it's the best we can do with what we have. 

Marker system?
&#10003;

Bring everything together
Hopefully by Wednesday...

Win!
